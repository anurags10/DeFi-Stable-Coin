# Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) Protocol

The Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) Protocol is a blockchain-based platform for minting and burning stablecoins. This protocol ensures a decentralized, trustless system for collateral management, liquidations, and monitoring user health factors. The project demonstrates a robust implementation of DeFi principles and provides a foundation for secure, scalable financial systems.

## Features of the Stablecoin

- **Relative Stability**

  - The stablecoin is anchored or pegged to a value of **$1.00**, maintaining relative stability through decentralized mechanisms.

- **Stability Mechanism (Minting)**

  - **Algorithmic (Decentralized)**: Minting of the stablecoin is governed by an algorithmic mechanism that ensures the system remains decentralized and transparent.

- **Collateral**

  - The stablecoin is backed by **exogenous collateral**, currently supporting the following assets:
    1. **wETH (Wrapped Ethereum)**
    2. **wBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)**

- **Testing Framework**
  - Built and tested using **Foundry**, ensuring high-quality smart contracts with robust unit and integration testing.
